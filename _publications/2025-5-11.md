### In-Hand Manipulation with Enforced Grasp Stability for Contact-Rich Tasks
- **Grasp Stability Objective**: Introduced a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates fingertip force-torque sensing into the observation space to encourage stable manipulation.
- **Force-Closure Reward**: Designed a physics-based reward using grasp wrench space analysis and singular value decomposition to promote contact-rich, secure grasps.
- **Policy Evaluation**: Demonstrated improved robustness and early learning efficiency in a cube reorientation task with a downward-facing multi-fingered hand.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with rich multi-modal feedback and parallelized simulation environments.
- **Video & Results**: [View Paper on OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YK2YeuL2rU)
