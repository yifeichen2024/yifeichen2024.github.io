### Pipe-finder: Adaptive, Lightweight Pipe Robot Integrating Origami Anisotropic Stiffness Structure
- **Innovative Design**: Devised a pioneering wheel pipeline robot design addressing efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability limitations of traditional rigid robots for pipeline navigation.
- **Origami Anisotropic Stiffness Structure (OASS)**: Integrated a stiffness structure inspired by the desert iguana's skin to balance rigidity and flexibility for efficient navigation.
- **Lightweight Construction**: Optimized the framework using PLA and resin materials, achieving a lightweight design of just 146 grams.
- **Pipeline Inspection Enhancement**: Presented a groundbreaking approach to enhance pipeline inspection robots' performance in complex networks.
- **Award Recognition**: Accepted to the 2023 IEEE ROBIO Conference and selected as a finalist for awards.
- **Video Available**: [Watch the demonstration](https://youtu.be/-3g1zD5PEoI?si=pOfvhxtRL9r6TgwL).
