### Explosive Legged Robotic Hopping: Power Manipulation and Amplification via Pneumatic Augmentation
- **Hybrid Energy Mechanism**: Designed and developed a system where kinetic energy from the robot's jump is stored as pneumatic energy, boosting the jumping capability.
- **Hardware Development**: Played a pivotal role in engineering the entire hardware infrastructure of the robot.
- **Hopper Control System**: Spearheaded the development of the robot's hopper control system.
- **Trajectory Optimization**: Conducted optimization for kinetic-to-pneumatic energy conversion to achieve maximal energy efficiency.
- **Video Available**: [Watch the demonstration](https://youtu.be/JObkOIaiOqE?si=GrjfINlKFIQjVoe1).
